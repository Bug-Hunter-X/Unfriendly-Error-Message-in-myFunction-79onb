# Unfriendly Error Message in myFunction

This repository contains a MATLAB function that throws an unhelpful error message when given negative input.  The bug is demonstrated in `bug.m`, and a solution is provided in `bugSolution.m`.

The original function provides a generic error message, making it difficult for the user to understand the issue. The solution improves the error message to include more specific information about the invalid input.
